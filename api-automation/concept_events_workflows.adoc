When a storage object in your data center crosses a threshold, you get a notification about that event. Using this notification, you can analyze the issue and take corrective action by using the `events` APIs.

This workflow takes the example of a volume as the resource object. You can use the `events` APIs to retrieve the list of events related to a volume, analyze the critical issues for that volume, and then take corrective actions to rectify the issue.

. Query all the events for the volumes by using the following parameters in the /management-server/events API:
 `"*resource_type": "volume*"`
 `"*severity": "critical*"`
+
[cols="3*",options="header"]
