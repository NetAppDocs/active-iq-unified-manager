The common workflows provide client application developers with examples of how Active IQ Unified Manager APIs can be called by a client application to execute common storage management functions. This section contains some of these sample workflows.

The workflows describe some of the commonly used storage management use cases along with sample codes for you to use. Each of the tasks is described using a workflow process consisting of one or more API calls.

== Understanding the API calls used in the workflows

You can view the online documentation page from your Unified Manager instance that includes the details of every REST API call. This document does not repeat the details of the online documentation. Each API call used in the workflow samples in this document includes only the information you need to locate the call on the documentation page. After locating a specific API call, you can review the complete details of the call, including the input parameters, output formats, HTTP status codes, and request processing type.

The following information is included for each API call within a workflow to help locate the call on the documentation page:

* Category: The API calls are organized on the documentation page into functionally related areas or categories. To locate a specific API call, scroll to the bottom of the page and click the applicable API category.
* HTTP verb (call): The HTTP verb identifies the action performed on a resource. Each API call is executed through a single HTTP verb.
* Path: The path determines the specific resource which the action applies to as part of performing a call. The path string is appended to the core URL to form the complete URL identifying the resource.
