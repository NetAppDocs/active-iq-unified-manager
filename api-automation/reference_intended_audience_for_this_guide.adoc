This guide is intended for developers creating applications that interface with the Active IQ Unified Manager software through REST APIs.

The guide is also intended for storage administrators and architects who want to gain a basic understanding of how the REST APIs that are provided in Unified Manager can be used to build client applications to manage and monitor NetApp storage systems.

You should use this guide if you want to use the storage provider, ONTAP cluster, and management administration APIs for managing your storage.

[NOTE]
====
You must have one of the following roles: Operator, Storage Administrator, or Application Administrator. You must know the IP address or fully qualified domain name of the Unified Manager server on which you want to execute the REST APIs.
