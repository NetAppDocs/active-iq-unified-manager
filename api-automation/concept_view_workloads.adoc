The storage workloads displayed can be for any LUN, NFS file share, or CIFS share. The API provides a storage workloads overview, an overview of the storage workloads provisioned by the Unified Manager, a data center overview, an overview of the total, used, and available space and IOPS in the data center, in terms of the assigned Performance Service Levels. The information received in response to this API is used to populate the dashboard in the Unified Manager UI.
