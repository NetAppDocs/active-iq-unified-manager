Modifying storage workloads consists of updating LUNs or file shares with missing parameters, or changing the existing parameters.

This workflow takes the example of updating Performance Service Levels for LUNs and file shares.

[NOTE]
====
The workflow assumes that the LUN or file share has been provisioned with Performance Service Levels.
====

== Modifying file shares

While modifying a file share, you can update the following parameters:

* Capacity or size.
* Online or offline setting.
* Storage Efficiency Policy.
* Performance Service Level.
* Access control list (ACL) settings.
* Export policy settings. You can also delete export policy parameters and revert the default (empty) export policy rules on the file share.

[NOTE]
====
During a single API run, you can update only one parameter.
====

This procedure describes adding a Performance Service Level to a file share. You can use the same procedure for updating any other file share property.

. Obtain the CIFS share or NFS file share key of the file share that you want to update. This API queries all the file shares on your data center. Skip this step if you already know the file share key.

[NOTE]

You can retrieve the details of the system-defined Performance Service Levels by setting the `system_defined` input parameter to `true`. From the output, obtain the key of the Performance Service Level that you want to apply to the file share.

In the input, you must specify only the parameter that you want to update, along with the file share key. In this case, it is the key of the Performance Service Level.

}"

The JSON output displays a Job object that you can use to verify the whether the access endpoints on the home and partner nodes have been created successfully.

. Verify whether the Performance Service Level has been added to the file share by using the Job object key displayed in your output.

If you query by the ID of the Job object, you see whether the file share is updated successfully. In case of a failure, troubleshoot the failure and run the API again. On successful creation, query the file share to see the modified object:

== Updating LUNs

While updating a LUN, you can modify the following parameters:

* Capacity or size
* Online or offline setting
* Storage Efficiency Policy
* Performance Service Level
* LUN map

[NOTE]
====
During a single API run, you can update only one parameter.
====

This procedure describes adding a Performance Service Level to a LUN. You can use the same procedure for updating any other LUN property.

. Obtain the LUN key of the LUN that you want to update. This API returns details of all the LUNS in your data center. Skip this step if you already know the LUN key.
