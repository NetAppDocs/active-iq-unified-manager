Active IQ Unified Manager provides you with a set of APIs under the `/datacenter` category that enable you to view the performance data of your clusters and storage objects in a data center. These APIs retrieve the performance data of the different storage objects such as clusters, nodes, LUNs, volumes, aggregates, storage VMs, FC interfaces, FC ports, Ethernet ports, and IP interfaces.

The `/metrics` and `/analytics` APIs give different views of the performance metrics, using which, you can drill down to different levels of details for the following storage objects in your data center:

* clusters
* nodes
* storage VMs
* aggregates
* volumes
* LUNs
* FC interfaces
* FC ports
* Ethernet ports
* IP interfaces


The following table draws a comparison between the `/metrics` and `/analytics` APIs with respect to the particulars of the performance data retrieved.
[cols="2*",options="header"]
|===
| Metrics| Analytics
a|
Performance details for a single object. For example, the `/datacenter/cluster/clusters/\{key}/metrics` API requires the cluster key to be entered as the path parameter for retrieving the metrics for that specific cluster.
a|
Performance details for multiple objects of the same type in a data center. For example, the `/datacenter/cluster/clusters/analytics` API retrieves the collective metrics of all the clusters in a data center.
a|
Performance metrics sample for a storage object based on the time interval parameter for retrieval.
a|
The high-level aggregated value of performance for a certain type of storage object for a certain period (above 72 hours).
a|
Basic details of the object are retrieved, such as details of a node or cluster.
a|
No specific details are retrieved.
a|
Accumulated counters, such as minimum, maximum, 95th percentile, and the average performance values over a period of time are retrieved for a single object, such as read, write, total, and other counters. For example, the `/datacenter/cluster/nodes/\{key}/metrics` API retrieves the following details (among others) for a node :
[NOTE]
The 95 percentile in the summary value indicates that 95% of the samples collected for the period have a counter value less than the value specified as the 95 percentile.
