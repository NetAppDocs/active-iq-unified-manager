When you have a protection relationship that is broken because the source volume is disabled and the destination is made a read/write volume, reverse resynchronization enables you to reverse the direction of the relationship so that the destination becomes the new source and the source becomes the new destination.

When a disaster disables the source volume in your protection relationship, you can use the destination volume to serve data by converting it to read/write, while you repair or replace the source, update the source, and reestablish the relationship. When you perform a reverse resync operation, data on the source that is newer than the data on the common Snapshot copy is deleted.
