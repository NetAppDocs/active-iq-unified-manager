The Relationship: Last 1 month Transfer Rate view enables you to analyze the amount of data volume that is transferred on a day-to-day basis for volumes in asynchronous relationships. This page also provides details about daily transfers and the time required to complete the transfer operation for volumes and Storage VMs.

The controls along the top of the page enable you to perform searches to locate specific objects, create and apply filters to narrow the list of displayed data, add/remove/reorder columns on the page, and export the data on the page to a .csv, .pdf, or .xlsx file. After you have customized the page, you can save the results as a custom view and then schedule a report of this data to be generated and emailed on a regular basis. For example, if you want to view volume relationships, you can access either the *Storage* > *Volumes* > *Relationship: Last 1 Month Transfer Rate* menu or access *Protection* > *Relationships* > *Relationships:Last 1 Month Transfer Rate* menu, and use the *Filter* to only view data for volumes.

* *Total Transfer Size*
+
Displays the total size of the volume transfer in gigabytes.

* *Day*

* *End Time*
