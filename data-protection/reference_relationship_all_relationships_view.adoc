The Relationship: All Relationships view displays information about protection relationships on the storage system.

By default, when you access the Relationships page, the report that is displayed includes the top-level protection relationships for both volumes and storage VMs. The controls along the top of the page enable you to select a particular view, perform searches to locate specific objects, create and apply filters to narrow the list of displayed data, add/remove/reorder columns on the page, and export the data on the page to a .csv, .pdf, or .xlsx file. After you have customized the page, you can save the results as a custom view and then schedule a report of this data to be generated and emailed on a regular basis. By default, when you select the *Relationships* menu, the report displayed includes protection relationships for both volumes and storage VMs in your datacenter. You can use the *Filter* option to view only selected storage systems like only volumes or only storage VMs. The same report is displayed in the Storage page and only for the selected storage entity. If you want to view either volume or storage VM relationships, you can access either the *Storage* > *Volumes* > *Relationship: All Relationships* page or access *Protection* > *Relationships* > *Relationship: All Relationships*, and use the *Relationship Object Type* option in the *Filter* to filter out only volumes or storage VMs data.

The Relationships page that lists all the protection relationships has the link *View in System Manager* for the Destination cluster that allows you to view the same objects in ONTAP System Manager.

* *Status*
+
Displays the current status of the protection relationship.
+
The status can be one of Error (image:../media/sev_error_um60.png[]), Warning (image:../media/sev_warning_um60.png[]), or OK (image:../media/sev_normal_um60.png[]).

* *Source Storage VM*
+
Displays the name of the source SVM. You can view more details about the source SVM by clicking the SVM name.
+
When a SVM exists on the cluster but has not yet been added to the Unified Manager inventory, or that the SVM was created after the cluster's last refresh, this field will be empty. You must ensure that the SVM exists, or perform a rediscovery on the cluster to refresh the list of resources.

* *Source*
+
Displays either the source volume or source storage VM being protected based on your selection. You can view more details about the source volume or storage VM by clicking the volume or storage VM name.
+
If the message `Resource-key not discovered` is displayed, this might indicate that the volume exists on the cluster but has not yet been added to the Unified Manager inventory, or that the volume was created after the cluster's last refresh. You must ensure that the volume exists, or perform a rediscovery on the cluster to refresh the list of resources.

* *Destination Storage VM*
+
Displays the name of the destination SVM. You can view more details about the destination SVM by clicking the SVM name.

* *Destination*
+
Displays the name of the destination volume or storage VM based on your selection. You can view more details about the destination volume or storage VM by clicking the respective object name.

* *Relationship Object Type*
+
Displays the type of object used in the relationship, such as storage VM, volume, and Consistency Group. For objects in a Consistency Relationship, the relationship source and destinations display the Consistency Group, and clicking them takes you to the LUNs page to view the relationship.

* *Policy*
+
Displays the name of the protection policy for SnapMirror relationship. You can click the policy name to view details associated with that policy, including the following information:

 ** Transfer Priority
+
Specifies the priority at which a transfer runs for asynchronous operations. The transfer priority is Normal or Low. Normal priority transfers are scheduled before low priority transfers. The default is Normal.

 ** Ignore Access Time
+
Applies only to SnapVault relationships. This specifies whether incremental transfers ignore files which have only their access time changed. The values are either True or False. The default is False.

 ** When Relationship is Out of Sync
+
Specifies the action ONTAP performs when a synchronous relationship is not able to be synchronized. StrictSync relationships will restrict access to the primary volume if there is a failure to synchronize with the secondary volume. Sync relationships do not restrict access to the primary if there is a failure to synchronize with the secondary.

 ** Tries Limit
+
Specifies the maximum number of times to attempt each manual or scheduled transfer for a SnapMirror relationship. The default is 8.

 ** Comments
+
Provides a text field for comments for specific to the selected policy.

 ** SnapMirror Label
+
Specifies the SnapMirror label for the first schedule associated with the Snapshot copy policy. The SnapMirror label is used by the SnapVault subsystem when you back up Snapshot copies to a SnapVault destination.

 ** Retention Setting
+
Specifies how long backups are kept, based on the time or the number of backups.

 ** Actual Snapshot Copies
+
Specifies the number of Snapshot copies on this volume that match the specified label.

 ** Preserve Snapshot Copies
+
Specifies the number of SnapVault Snapshot copies that are not deleted automatically even if the maximum limit for the policy is reached. The values are either True or False. The default is False.

 ** Retention Warning Threshold
+
Specifies the Snapshot copy limit at which a warning is sent to indicate that the maximum retention limit is nearly reached.

* *Lag Duration*
+
Displays the amount of time that the data on the mirror lags behind the source.
+
The lag duration should be close to, or equal to, 0 seconds for StrictSync relationships.

* *Lag Status*
+
Displays the lag status for managed relationships, and for unmanaged relationships that have a schedule associated with that relationship. Lag status can be:

 ** Error
+
The lag duration is greater than or equal to the lag error threshold.

 ** Warning
+
The lag duration is greater than or equal to the lag warning threshold.

 ** OK
+
The lag duration is within normal limits.

 ** Not Applicable
+
The lag status is not applicable for synchronous relationships because a schedule cannot be configured.

* *Last Successful Update*
+
Displays the time of the last successful SnapMirror or SnapVault operation.
+
The last successful update is not applicable for synchronous relationships.

* *Constituent Relationships*
+
Displays whether there are any volumes in the selected object.

* *Relationship Type*
+
Displays the relationship type used to replicate a volume. Relationship types include:

 ** Asynchronous Mirror
 ** Asynchronous Vault
 ** Asynchronous MirrorVault
 ** StrictSync
 ** Sync

* *Transfer Status*
+
Displays the transfer status for the protection relationship. The transfer status can be one of the following:

 ** Aborting
+
SnapMirror transfers are enabled; however, a transfer abort operation that might include removal of the checkpoint is in progress.

 ** Checking
+
The destination volume is undergoing a diagnostic check and no transfer is in progress.

 ** Finalizing

 ** Transferring
+
SnapMirror transfers are enabled and a transfer is in progress.

 ** Transitioning
+
The asynchronous transfer of data from the source to the destination volume is complete, and the transition to synchronous operation has started.

 ** Waiting
+
A SnapMirror transfer has been initiated, but some associated tasks are waiting to be queued.
