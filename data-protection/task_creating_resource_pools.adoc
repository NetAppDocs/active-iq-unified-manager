You can use the Create Resource Pool dialog box to group aggregates for provisioning purposes.

You must have the Application Administrator or Storage Administrator role.

Resource pools can contain aggregates from different clusters, but the same aggregate cannot belong to different resource pools.

. In the left navigation pane, click *Protection* > *Resource Pools*.
. In the Resource Pools page, click *Create*.
. Follow the instructions in the Create Resource Pool dialog box to provide a name and description and to add aggregates as members to the resource pool you want to create.
