You use the Select Source Snapshot Copy dialog box to select a specific Snapshot copy to transfer data between protection relationships, or you select the default behavior, which varies depending on whether you are initializing, updating, or resynchronizing a relationship, and whether the relationship is a SnapMirror or SnapVault.

If you are performing a SnapVault transfer, the default behavior for each operation is as follows:

|===
| Operation| Default SnapVault behavior when source is read/write| Default SnapVault behavior when source is Data Protection (DP)
a|
Initialize
a|
Creates a new Snapshot copy and transfers it.
a|
Transfers the last exported Snapshot copy.
a|
Update
a|
Transfers only labeled Snapshot copies, as specified in the policy.
a|
Transfers the last exported Snapshot copy.
a|
Resynchronize
a|
Transfers all labeled Snapshot copies created after the newest common Snapshot copy.
a|
Transfers the newest labeled Snapshot copy.
|===
If you are performing a SnapMirror transfer, the default behavior for each operation is as follows:

[cols="3*",options="header"]
|===
| Operation| Default SnapMirror behavior| Default SnapMirror behavior when relationship is second hop in a SnapMirror to SnapMirror cascade
a|
