You can better ensure conformance in partner applications if you observe some SVM association and resource pool requirements that are specific to storage services: for example, when you associate SVM and create resource pools in Unified Manager to support a protection topology in a storage service provided by a partner application.

Some applications partner with the Unified Manager server to provide services that automatically configure and execute SnapMirror or SnapVault backup protection between source volumes and protection volumes in secondary or tertiary locations. To support these protection storage services, you must use Unified Manager to configure the necessary SVM associations and resource pools.

To support storage service single-hop or cascaded protection, including replication from a SnapMirror source or SnapVault primary volume to either destination SnapMirror or to SnapVault backup volumes that reside in secondary or tertiary locations, observe the following requirements:

* SVM associations must be configured between the SVM containing the SnapMirror source or SnapVault primary volume and any SVM on which either a secondary volume or a tertiary volume resides.
 ** For example, to support a protection topology in which source volume Vol_A resides on SVM_1, and SnapMirror secondary destination volume Vol_B resides on SVM_2, and tertiary SnapVault backup volume Vol_ C resides on SVM_3, you must use the Unified Manager web UI to configure a SnapMirror association between SVM_1 and SVM_2 and a SnapVault backup association between SVM_1 and SVM_3.
+
In this example, any SnapMirror association or SnapVault backup association between SVM_2 and SVM_3 is not necessary and is not used.

 ** To support a protection topology in which both source volume Vol_A and SnapMirror destination volume Vol_B reside on SVM_1, you must configure a SnapMirror association between SVM_1 and SVM_1.
* The resource pools must include cluster aggregate resources available to the associated SVMs.
+
You configure resource pools through the Unified Manager web UI and then assign through the partner application the storage service secondary target and tertiary target nodes.
