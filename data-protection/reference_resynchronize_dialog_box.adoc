The Resynchronize dialog box enables you to resynchronize data on a SnapMirror or SnapVault relationship that was previously broken and then the destination was made a read/write volume. You might also resynchronize when a required common Snapshot copy on the source volume is deleted causing SnapMirror or SnapVault updates to fail.

== Resynchronization Options tab

The Resynchronization Options tab enables you to set the transfer priority and the maximum transfer rate for the protection relationship that you are resynchronizing.

* *Transfer Priority*
+
The priority at which the transfer is run. You can select either Normal or Low. Relationships with policies that specify a normal transfer priority run before those with policies that specify a low transfer priority.

* *Max Transfer Rate*
+
Specifies the maximum rate at which data is transferred between clusters over the network. When selected, network bandwidth is limited to the value that you specify. You can enter a numerical value and then select either kilobytes per second (KBps), megabytes per second (MBps), gigabytes per second (GBps), or TBps. If you choose not to use a maximum transfer rate, the baseline transfer between relationships is unlimited.

== Source Snapshot Copies tab

The Source Snapshot Copies tab displays the following information about the source Snapshot copy that is used for the baseline transfer:

* *Source Volume*
+
Displays the names of the corresponding source volumes.

* *Destination Volume*
+
Displays the names of the selected destination volumes.

* *Source Type*
+
Displays the volume type: either Read/write or Data Protection.

* *Snapshot Copy*
+
Displays the Snapshot copy that is used for the data transfer. Clicking the Snapshot copy value displays the Select Source Snapshot Copy dialog box, in which can select a specific Snapshot copy for your transfer, depending on the type of protection relationship you have and the operation you are performing.

== Command buttons

* *Submit*
+
Begins the resynchronization process and closes the Resynchronize dialog box.

* *Cancel*
+
Cancels your selections and closes the Resynchronize dialog box.
