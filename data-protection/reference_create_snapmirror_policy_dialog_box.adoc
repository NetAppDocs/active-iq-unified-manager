The Create SnapMirror Policy dialog box enables you to create a policy to set the priority for SnapMirror transfers. You use policies to maximize the efficiency of transfers from the source to the destination.

* *Destination Cluster*
+
The name of the cluster you selected in the SnapMirror tab of the Configure Protection dialog box.

* *Destination SVM*
+
The name of the SVM you selected in the SnapMirror tab of the Configure Protection dialog box.

* *Policy Name*
+
The name you provide for the new policy. Policy names can consist of the characters A through Z, a through z, 0 through 9, period (.), hyphen (-), and underscore (_).

* *Transfer Priority*
+
The priority at which a transfer runs for asynchronous operations. You can select either Normal or Low. Transfer relationships with policies that specify a normal transfer priority run before those with policies that specify a low transfer priority.

* *Comment*
+
An optional field in which you can add comments about the policy.

* *Transfer Restart*
+
Indicates what restart action to take when a transfer is interrupted by an abort operation or any type of failure, such as a network outage. You can select one of the following:

 ** Always
+
Specifies that a new Snapshot copy is created before restarting a transfer, then, if one exists, the transfer is restarted from a checkpoint, followed by an incremental transfer from the newly created Snapshot copy.

 ** Never
+
Specifies that interrupted transfers are never restarted.

== Command buttons

The command buttons enable you to perform the following tasks:

* *Cancel*
+
Discards the selections and closes the Configure Protection dialog box.

* *Apply*
+
Applies your selections and begins the protection process.
