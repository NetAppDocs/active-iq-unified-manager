You can abort an active data protection transfer when you want to stop a SnapMirror replication that is in progress. You can also clear the restart checkpoint for transfers subsequent to the baseline transfer. You might abort a transfer when it conflicts with another operation, such as a volume move.

*NOTE:* You cannot abort volumes relationships that are protected by the Consistency Group.

*What you'll need*

* You must have the Application Administrator or Storage Administrator role.
* You must have set up Workflow Automation.

The abort action does not display in the following instances:

* If RBAC settings do not allow this action: for example, if you have only operator privileges
* When the volume ID is unknown: for example, when you have an intercluster relationship and the destination cluster has not yet been discovered

You cannot clear the restart checkpoint for a baseline transfer.


.Steps

. To abort transfers for one or more protection relationships, from the *Volume Relationships* page, select one or more volumes and, on the toolbar, click *Abort*.
+
The Abort Transfer dialog box is displayed.

. If you want to clear the restart checkpoint for a transfer that is not a baseline transfer, select *Clear Checkpoints*.
. Click *Continue*.
+
The Abort Transfer dialog box is closed, and the status of the abort job displays at the top of the Volume Relationships page, along with a link to the job details.

. *Optional:* Click the *View details* link to go to the *Job* details page for additional details and to view job progress.
