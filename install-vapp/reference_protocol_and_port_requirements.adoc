[.lead]
The required ports and protocols enable communication between the Unified Manager server and the managed storage systems, servers, and other components.

== Connections to the Unified Manager server

In typical installations you do not have to specify port numbers when connecting to the Unified Manager web UI, because default ports are always used. For example, because Unified Manager always attempts to run on its default port, you can enter `+https://<host>+` instead of `+https://<host>:443+`.

[NOTE]
The default port for MySQL, 3306, is restricted only to localhost while installing Unified Manager on VMware vSphere systems. This does not impact any upgrade scenario, where the previous configuration is maintained. This configuration can be modified and the connection can be made available to other hosts through the maintenance console.

The Unified Manager server uses specific protocols to access the following interfaces:

[cols="4*",options="header"]
|===
| Interface| Protocol| Port| Description
a|
Unified Manager web UI
a|
HTTP
a|
80
a|
Used to access the Unified Manager web UI; automatically redirects to the secure port 443.
a|
Unified Manager web UI and programs using APIs
a|
HTTPS
a|
443
a|
Used to securely access the Unified Manager web UI or to make API calls; API calls can only be made using HTTPS.
a|
Maintenance console
a|
SSH/SFTP
a|
22
a|
Used to access the maintenance console and retrieve support bundles.
a|
Linux command line
a|
SSH/SFTP
a|
22
a|
Used to access the Red Hat Enterprise Linux or CentOS command line and retrieve support bundles.
a|
Syslog
a|

[NOTE]
====
The ports used for HTTP and HTTPS communication (ports 80 and 443) can be changed using the Unified Manager maintenance console. For more information, see the _Active IQ Unified Manager System Configuration Guide_.

== Connections from the Unified Manager server

You should configure your firewall to open ports that enable communication between the Unified Manager server and managed storage systems, servers, and other components. If a port is not open, communication fails.

Depending on your environment, you can choose to modify the ports and protocols used by the Unified Manager server to connect to specific destinations.

The Unified Manager server connects using the following protocols and ports to the managed storage systems, servers, and other components:

[cols="4*",options="header"]
|===
| Destination| Protocol| Port| Description
a|
Storage system
a|
HTTPS
a|
443/TCP
a|
Used to monitor and manage storage systems.

[NOTE]
If you are using this port, or any other port to connect to the VMware vCenter Server or ESXi server, ensure that the port is available and can be connected in a secured site.

a|
Storage system
a|
NDMP
a|
10000/TCP
a|
Used for certain Snapshot restore operations.
a|
AutoSupport server
a|
