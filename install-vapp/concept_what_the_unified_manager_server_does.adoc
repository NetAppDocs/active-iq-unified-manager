The Unified Manager server infrastructure consists of a data collection unit, a database, and an application server. It provides infrastructure services such as discovery, monitoring, role-based access control (RBAC), auditing, and logging.

Unified Manager collects cluster information, stores the data in the database, and analyzes the data to see if there are any cluster issues.
