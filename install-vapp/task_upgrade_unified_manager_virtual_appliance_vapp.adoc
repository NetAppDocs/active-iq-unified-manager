* For vSphere 6.5 and later users, you have installed the VMware Remote Console (VMRC).
* During upgrade, you may be prompted to confirm on whether you want to keep the previous, default settings for retaining performance data for 13 months or to change it to 6 months. On confirming, the historical performance data is purged after 6 months.
* You have the following information:
 ** Login credentials for the NetApp Support Site
 ** Credentials for accessing the VMware vCenter Server and vSphere Web Client
 ** Credentials for the Unified Manager maintenance user

During the upgrade process, Unified Manager is unavailable. You should complete any running operations before upgrading Unified Manager.

If you have paired Workflow Automation and Unified Manager, you should manually update the host name in Workflow Automation.
