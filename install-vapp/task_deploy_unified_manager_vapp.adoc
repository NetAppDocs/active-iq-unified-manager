Deploying Unified Manager includes downloading software, deploying the virtual appliance, creating a maintenance user name and password, and performing the initial setup in the web UI.

*What you'll need*

* You should verify and complete the system requirements for deployment.

link:concept_requirements_for_installing_unified_manager.html[System requirements]

* Ensure that you have the following information:
 ** Login credentials for the NetApp Support Site
 ** Credentials for accessing the VMware vCenter Server and vSphere Web Client
 ** IP address of the ESXi server on which you are deploying the Unified Manager virtual appliance
 ** Details about the data center, such as storage space in the datastore and memory requirements
 ** IPv6 should be enabled on the host if you are planning to use IPv6 addressing.

You can deploy Unified Manager as a virtual appliance on a VMware ESXi server.

You should access the maintenance console by using the VMware console, and not by using SSH.

[NOTE]
====
Starting with Unified Manager 9.8, VMware Tools has been replaced with Open VM Tools (`open-vm-tools`). You no longer have to install VMware Tools as part of the installation because `open-vm-tools` is included with the Unified Manager installation package.
====

After finishing the deployment and initial setup, you can either add clusters, or configure additional network settings in the maintenance console, and then access the web UI.
