The Support and Diagnostics menu enables you to generate a support bundle that you can send to technical support for troubleshooting assistance.

The following menu options are available:

* *Generate Light Support Bundle*
+
Enables you to produce a lightweight support bundle that contains just 30 days of logs and configuration database records -- it excludes performance data, acquisition recording files, and server heap dump.

* *Generate Support Bundle*
+
Enables you to create a full support bundle (7-Zip file) containing diagnostic information in the diagnostic user's home directory. If your system is connected to the internet you can also upload the support bundle to NetApp.
+
The file includes information generated by an AutoSupport message, the contents of the Unified Manager database, detailed data about the Unified Manager server internals, and verbose-level logs not normally included in AutoSupport messages or in the lightweight support bundle.
