For security reasons, you must change the default password for the Unified Manager umadmin user immediately after completing the installation process. If necessary, you can change the password again anytime later.

*What you'll need*

* Unified Manager must be installed on a Red Hat Enterprise Linux or CentOS Linux system.
* You must have the root user credentials for the Linux system on which Unified Manager is installed.

.Steps

. Log in as the root user to the Linux system on which Unified Manager is running.
. Change the umadmin password:
+
`passwd umadmin`
+
The system prompts you to enter a new password for the umadmin user.
