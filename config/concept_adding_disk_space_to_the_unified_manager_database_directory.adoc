[.lead]
The Unified Manager database directory contains all of the health and performance data collected from ONTAP systems. Some circumstances may require that you increase the size of the database directory.

For example, the database directory may get full if Unified Manager is collecting data from a large number of clusters where each cluster has many nodes. You will receive a warning event when the database directory is 90% full, and a critical event when the directory is 95% full.

[NOTE]
====
No additional data is collected from clusters after the directory reaches 95% full.
====

The steps required to add capacity to the data directory are different depending on whether Unified Manager is running on a VMware ESXi server, on a Red Hat or CentOS Linux server, or on a Microsoft Windows server.
