You can upload and install a security certificate after a Certificate Authority has signed and returned it. The file that you upload and install must be a signed version of the existing self-signed certificate. A CA-signed certificate helps prevent man-in-the middle attacks and provides better security protection than a self-signed certificate.

*What you'll need*

You must have completed the following actions:

* Downloaded the Certificate Signing Request file and had it signed by a Certificate Authority
* Saved the certificate chain in PEM format
* Included all certificates in the chain, from the Unified Manager server certificate to the root signing certificate, including any intermediate certificates present

You must have the Application Administrator role.

[NOTE]
====
If the validity of certificate for which a CSR was created is more than 397 days, then the validity will be reduced to 397 days by the CA before signing and returning the certificate
