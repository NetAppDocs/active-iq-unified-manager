You can specify the inactivity timeout value for Active IQ Unified Manager. After an inactivity of the specified time, the application is automatically logged out. This option is enabled by default.

You can deactivate this feature or modify the time from *General* > *Feature Settings* > *Inactivity Timeout*. Once you activate this feature, you should specify the time limit of inactivity (in minutes) in the *LOGOUT AFTER* field, after which the system automatically logs out. The default value is 4320 minutes (72 hours).
