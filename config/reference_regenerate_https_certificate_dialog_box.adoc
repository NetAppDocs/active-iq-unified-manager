The Regenerate HTTPS Certificate dialog box enables you to customize the security information and then generate a new HTTPS certificate with that information.

The current certificate information appears on this page.

The "`Regenerate Using Current Certificate Attributes`" and "`Update the Current Certificate Attributes`" selection enables you to regenerate the certificate with the current information or generate a certificate with new information.

The default validity period is 397 days. If you have upgraded from a previous version, you might see the previous certificate validity unchanged.
