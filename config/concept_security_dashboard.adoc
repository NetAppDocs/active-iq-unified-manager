By using the *Customize* button on the *Security Dashboard* panel of the Features Settings page, you can enable or disable the security parameters for compliance monitoring on Unified Manager.

The settings that are enabled or disabled from this page govern the overall compliance status of the clusters and storage VMs on Unified Manager. Based on the selections, the corresponding columns are visible in the *Security: All Clusters* view of the Clusters inventory page and the *Security: All Storage VMs* view of the Storage VMs inventory page.

[NOTE]
====
Only users with administrator role can edit these settings.
====

The security criteria for your ONTAP clusters, storage VMs, and volumes are evaluated against the recommendations defined in the link:https://www.netapp.com/pdf.html?item=/media/10674-tr4569pdf.pdf[Security Hardening Guide for NetApp ONTAP 9]. The Security panel on the dashboard and the Security page display the default security compliance status of your clusters, storage VMs, and volumes. Security events are also generated and management actions enabled for the clusters and storage VMs that have security violations.
