Active IQ Unified Manager supports a specific upgrade path for each version.

Not all versions of Unified Manager can perform an in-place upgrade to later versions. The Unified Manager upgrades are limited to an N-2 model, meaning an upgrade can only be performed within the next 2 releases on all platforms. For example, you can upgrade Unified Manager to 9.12 from Unified Manager 9.10 and 9.11 only. 

Earlier versions of Unified Manager follow this sample path:

.Sample upgrade path from OnCommand Unified Manager 9.5 to Active IQ Unified Manager 9.12: 

. Upgrade from OnCommand Unified Manager 9.5 to Active IQ Unified Manager 9.7 
. Upgrade from 9.7 to 9.9 
. Upgrade from 9.9 to 9.11 
. Upgrade from 9.11 to 9.12
