You can use scripts to automatically modify or update multiple storage objects in Unified Manager. The script is associated with an alert. When an event triggers an alert, the script is executed. You can upload custom scripts and test their execution when an alert is generated.

The ability to upload scripts to Unified Manager and run them is enabled by default. If your organization does not want to allow this functionality because of security reasons, you can disable this functionality from *Storage Management* > *Feature Settings*.
