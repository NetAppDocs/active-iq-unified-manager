[.lead]
The Cluster / Health details page provides detailed information about a selected cluster, such as health, capacity, and configuration details. You can also view information about the network interfaces (LIFs), nodes, disks, related devices, and related alerts for the cluster.

The status next to the cluster name, for example (Good), represents the communication status; whether Unified Manager can communicate with the cluster. It does not represent the failover status or overall status of the cluster.

== Command buttons

The command buttons enable you to perform the following tasks for the selected cluster:

* *Switch to Performance View*
+
Enables you to navigate to the Cluster / Performance details page.

* *Actions*
 ** Add Alert: Opens the Add Alert dialog box, which enables you to add an alert to the selected cluster.
 ** Rediscover: Initiates a manual refresh of the cluster, which enables Unified Manager to discover recent changes to the cluster.
+
If Unified Manager is paired with OnCommand Workflow Automation, the rediscovery operation also reacquires cached data from WFA, if any.
+
After the rediscovery operation is initiated, a link to the associated job details is displayed to enable tracking of the job status.

 ** Annotate: Enables you to annotate the selected cluster.
* *View Clusters*
+
Enables you to navigate to the Health: All Clusters view.

== Health tab

Displays detailed information about the data availability and data capacity issues of various cluster objects such as nodes, SVMs, and aggregates. Availability issues are related to the data-serving capability of the cluster objects. Capacity issues are related to the data-storing capability of the cluster objects.

You can click the graph of an object to view a filtered list of the objects. For example, you can click the SVM capacity graph that displays warnings to view a filtered list of SVMs. This list contains SVMs that have volumes or qtrees that have capacity issues with a severity level of Warning. You can also click the SVMs availability graph that displays warnings to view the list of SVMs that have availability issues with a severity level of Warning.

=== Availability Issues

Graphically displays the total number of objects, including objects that have availability issues and objects that do not have any availability-related issues. The colors in the graph represent the different severity levels of the issues. The information below the graph provides details about availability issues that can impact or have already impacted the availability of data in the cluster. For example, information is displayed about disk shelves that are down and aggregates that are offline.

[NOTE]
====
The data displayed for the SFO bar graph is based on the HA state of the nodes. The data displayed for all other bar graphs is calculated based on the events generated.
====

=== Capacity Issues

Graphically displays the total number of objects, including objects that have capacity issues and objects that do not have any capacity-related issues.
