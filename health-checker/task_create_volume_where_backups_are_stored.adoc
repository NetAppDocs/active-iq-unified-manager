You can configure the volume where Snapshot backups will be stored on one of your ONTAP clusters using ONTAP System Manager or using the ONTAP CLI.

*What you'll need*

The cluster, storage VM, and volume must meet the following requirements:

* Cluster requirements:
 ** ONTAP 9.3 or greater must be installed
 ** It should be geographically close to the Unified Manager server
 ** It can be monitored by Unified Manager, but it is not required
* Storage VM requirements:
 ** The name switch and name mapping must be set to use "`files`"
 ** Local users created to correspond with client-side users
 ** Make sure All Read/Write access is selected
 ** Make sure that Superuser Access is set to "`any`" in the export policy
 ** NFS for NetApp Snapshot for Linux
 ** NFSv4 must be enabled on the NFS server and NFSv4 ID domain specified on the client and storage VM
 ** The volume should be at least double the size of the Unified Manager/opt/netapp/data directory
+
Use the command du -sh /opt/netapp/data/ to check the current size.
* Volume requirements:
 ** The volume should be at least double the size of the Unified Manager /opt/netapp/data directory
 ** The security style must be set to UNIX
 ** The local snapshot policy must be disabled
 ** Volume autosize should be enabled
 ** The performance service level should be set to a policy with high IOPS and low latency, such as "`Extreme`"
