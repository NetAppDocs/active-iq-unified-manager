[.lead]
A MySQL database restore is the process of restoring an existing Unified Manager backup file to the same or a different Unified Manager server. You perform the restore operation from the Unified Manager maintenance console.

If you are performing a restore operation on the same (local) system, and the backup files are all stored locally, you can run the restore option using the default location. If you are performing a restore operation on a different Unified Manager system (a remote system), you must copy the backup file, or files, from secondary storage to the local disk before running the restore option.

During the restore process, you are logged out of Unified Manager. You can log in to the system after the restore process is complete.

If you are restoring the backup image to a new server, after the restore operation completes you need to generate a new HTTPS security certificate and restart the Unified Manager server. You will also need to reconfigure SAML authentication settings, if they are required, when restoring the backup image to a new server.

[NOTE]
====
Old backup files cannot be used to restore an image after Unified Manager has been upgraded to a newer version of software. To save space, all old backup files, except the newest file, are removed automatically when you upgrade Unified Manager.
