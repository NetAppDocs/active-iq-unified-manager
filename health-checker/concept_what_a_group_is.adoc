A group is a dynamic collection of heterogeneous storage objects (clusters, SVMs, or volumes). You can create groups in Unified Manager to easily manage a set of storage objects. The members in a group might change, depending on the storage objects that are monitored by Unified Manager at a point in time.

* Each group has a unique name.
* You must configure a minimum of one group rule for each group.
* You can associate a group with more than one group rule.
* Each group can include multiple types of storage objects such as clusters, SVMs, or volumes.
* Storage objects are dynamically added to a group based on when a group rule is created or when Unified Manager completes a monitoring cycle.
* You can simultaneously apply actions on all the storage objects in a group such as setting thresholds for volumes.
