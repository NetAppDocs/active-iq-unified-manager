You can use the Volume / Health details page to view detailed information about a selected volume, such as capacity, storage efficiency, configuration, protection, annotation, and events generated. You can also view information about the related objects and related alerts for that volume.

You must have the Application Administrator or Storage Administrator role.

== Command buttons

The command buttons enable you to perform the following tasks for the selected volume:

* *Switch to Performance View*
+
Enables you to navigate to the Volume / Performance details page.

* *Actions*
 ** Add Alert
+
Enables you to add an alert to the selected volume.

 ** Edit Thresholds
+
Enables you to modify the threshold settings for the selected volume.

 ** Annotate
+
Enables you to annotate the selected volume.

 ** Protect
+
Enables you to create either SnapMirror or SnapVault relationships for the selected volume.

 ** Relationship
+
Enables you to execute the following protection relationship operations:

  *** Edit
+
Launches the Edit Relationship dialog box which enables you to change existing SnapMirror policies, schedules, and maximum transfer rates for an existing protection relationship.

  *** Abort
+
Aborts transfers that are in progress for a selected relationship. Optionally, it enables you to remove the restart checkpoint for transfers other than the baseline transfer. You cannot remove the checkpoint for a baseline transfer.

  *** Quiesce
+
Temporarily disables scheduled updates for a selected relationship. Transfers that are already in progress must complete before the relationship is quiesced.

  *** Break
+
Breaks the relationship between the source and destination volumes and changes the destination to a read-write volume.

  *** Remove
+
Permanently deletes the relationship between the selected source and destination. The volumes are not destroyed and the Snapshot copies on the volumes are not removed. This operation cannot be undone.

  *** Resume
+
Enables scheduled transfers for a quiesced relationship. At the next scheduled transfer interval, a restart checkpoint is used, if one exists.

  *** Resynchronize
+
Enables you to resynchronize a previously broken relationship.

  *** Initialize/Update
+
Enables you to perform a first-time baseline transfer on a new protection relationship, or to perform a manual update if the relationship is already initialized.

  *** Reverse Resync
+
Enables you to reestablish a previously broken protection relationship, reversing the function of the source and destination by making the source a copy of the original destination. The contents on the source are overwritten by the contents on the destination, and any data that is newer than the data on the common Snapshot copy is deleted.

 ** Restore
+
Enables you to restore data from one volume to another volume.
For information, see link:../data-protection/task_restore_data_use_health_volume_details_page.html[Restoring data using the Volume / Health details page].

 ** Used
+
Displays the amount of logical space that is being used by data in the volume, and the percentage of logical space used based on the total data capacity.

 ** Logical Space Enforcement
+
Displays whether logical space enforcement is configured for thinly provisioned volumes. When set to Enabled, the logical used size of the volume cannot be greater than the currently set physical volume size.

* *Autogrow*
+
Displays whether the volume automatically grows when it is out of space.

* *Space Guarantee*
+
Displays the FlexVol volume setting control when a volume removes free blocks from an aggregate. These blocks are then guaranteed to be available for writes to files in the volume. The space guarantee can be set to one of the following:

 ** None
+
No space guarantee is configured for the volume.

 ** File
+
Full size of sparsely written files (for example, LUNs) is guaranteed.

 ** Volume
+
Full size of the volume is guaranteed.

 ** Partial
+
The FlexCache volume reserves space based on its size. If the FlexCache volume's size is 100 MB or more, the minimum space guarantee is set to 100 MB by default. If the FlexCache volume's size is less than 100 MB, the minimum space guarantee is set to the FlexCache volume's size. If the FlexCache volume's size is grown later, the minimum space guarantee is not incremented.
