You can delete a group action from Unified Manager when the group action is no longer required.

*What you'll need*

You must have the Application Administrator or Storage Administrator role.

When you delete the group action for the volume health threshold, global thresholds are applied to the storage objects in that group. Any object-level health thresholds that are set on the storage object are not impacted.

.Steps
. In the left navigation pane, click *Storage Management* > *Groups*.
. In the *Group Actions* tab, select the group action that you want to delete, and then click *Delete*.
. In the *Warning* dialog box, confirm the deletion by clicking *Yes*.
