You can edit the name and description of a group that you created in Unified Manager.

You must have the Application Administrator or Storage Administrator role.

When you edit a group to update the name, you must specify a unique name; you cannot use an existing group name.

. In the left navigation pane, click *Storage Management* > *Groups*.
. In the Groups tab, select the group that you want to edit, and then click *Edit*.
. In the Edit Group dialog box, change the name, description, or both for the group.
. Click *Save*.
