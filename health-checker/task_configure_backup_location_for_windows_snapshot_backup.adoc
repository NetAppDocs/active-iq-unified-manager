You should configure the volume for Snapshot backups to be stored even when you have Active IQ Unified Manager installed on Windows.

*What you'll need*

The cluster, storage VM, and volume must meet the following requirements:

* Cluster requirements:
 ** ONTAP 9.3 or greater must be installed
 ** It should be geographically close to the Unified Manager server
 ** It is monitored by Unified Manager
* Storage VM requirements:
 ** iSCSI connectivity on ONTAP cluster
 ** iSCSI protocol must be enabled for the configured machine
 ** You should have a dedicated volume and LUN for backup configuration. The selected volume should contain only one LUN and nothing else.
 ** The size of the LUN should be at least twice the data size expected to be handled in the 9.9 Active IQ Unified Manager.
+
This sets the same size requirement on volume as well.

 ** Make sure All Read/Write access is selected
 ** Make sure that Superuser Access is set to "`any`" in the export policy
* Volume and LUN requirements:
 ** The volume should be at least double the size of the Unified Manager MySQL data directory.
 ** The security style must be set to Windows
 ** The local snapshot policy must be disabled
 ** Volume autosize should be enabled
 ** The performance service level should be set to a policy with high IOPS and low latency, such as "`Extreme`"
