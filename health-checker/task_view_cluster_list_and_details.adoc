You can use the Health: All Clusters view to view your inventory of clusters. The Capacity: All Clusters view enables you to view summarized information about storage capacity and utilization in all clusters.

*What you'll need*

You must have the Operator, Application Administrator, or Storage Administrator role.

You can also view details for individual clusters such as the cluster health, capacity, configuration, LIFs, nodes, and disks in that cluster by using the Cluster / Health details page.

The details in the Health: All Clusters view, Capacity: All Clusters view, and the Cluster / Health details page help you plan your storage. For example, before provisioning a new aggregate, you can select a specific cluster from the Health: All Clusters view and obtain capacity details to determine if the cluster has the required space.

.Steps
. In the left navigation pane, click *Storage* > *Clusters*.
. In the View menu, select *Health: All Clusters* view to view health information, or *Capacity: All Clusters* view to view details about storage capacity and utilization in all clusters.
. Click the name of a cluster to view complete details of the cluster in the *Cluster / Health* details page.
