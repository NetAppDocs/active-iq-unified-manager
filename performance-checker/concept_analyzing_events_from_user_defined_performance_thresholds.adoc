Events generated from user-defined thresholds indicate that a performance counter for a certain storage object, for example, an aggregate or volume, has crossed the threshold you defined in the policy. This indicates that the cluster object is experiencing a performance issue.

You use the Event details page to analyze the performance event and take corrective action, if necessary, to return performance back to normal.
