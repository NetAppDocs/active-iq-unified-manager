The collection interval for _cluster configuration data_ is 15 minutes. For example, after you have added a cluster, it takes 15 minutes to display the cluster details in the Unified Manager UI. This interval applies when making changes to a cluster too.

For example, if you add two new volumes to an SVM in a cluster, you see those new objects in the UI after the next polling interval, which could be up to 15 minutes.

Unified Manager collects current _performance statistics_ from all monitored clusters every five minutes. It analyzes this data to identify performance events and potential issues. It retains 30 days of five-minute historical performance data and 180 days of one-hour historical performance data. This enables you to view very granular performance details for the current month, and general performance trends for up to a year.

The collection polls are offset by a few minutes so that data from every cluster is not sent at the same time, which could affect performance.

The following table describes the collection activities that Unified Manager performs:

|===
| Activity| Time interval| Description
a|
Performance statistics poll
a|
Every 5 minutes
a|
Collects real-time performance data from each cluster.
a|
Statistical analysis
a|
Every 5 minutes
a|
After every statistics poll, Unified Manager compares the collected data against user-defined, system-defined, and dynamic thresholds.

If any performance thresholds have been breached, Unified Manager generates events and sends email to specified users, if configured to do so.

a|
Configuration poll
a|
Every 15 minutes
a|
Collects detailed inventory information from each cluster to identify all the storage objects (nodes, SVMs, volumes, and so on).
a|
Summarization
a|
Every hour
a|
Summarizes the latest 12 five-minute performance data collections into hourly averages.

The hourly average values are used in some of the UI pages, and they are retained for 180 days.

a|
Forecast analysis and data pruning
a|
Every day after midnight
a|
Analyzes cluster data to establish dynamic thresholds for volume latency and IOPS for the next 24 hours.

Deletes from the database any five-minute performance data older than 30 days.

a|
Data pruning
a|
Every day after 2 a.m.
a|
Deletes from the database any events older than 180 days and dynamic thresholds older than 180 days.
a|
Data pruning
a|
Every day after 3:30 a.m.
a|
Deletes from the database any one-hour performance data older than 180 days.
