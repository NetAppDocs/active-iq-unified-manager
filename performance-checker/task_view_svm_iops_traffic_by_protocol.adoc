You can view detailed IOPS information for an SVM by using the Performance/SVM Explorer page. The IOPS - Total counter chart shows total IOPS usage on the SVM, and the IOPS - Breakdown counter chart is useful for determining the impact of read, write, and other IOPS on the SVM.

Additionally, the IOPS - Protocols chart shows a detailed comparison of the IOPS traffic for each protocol that is being used on the SVM. The following protocols are available:

* CIFS
* NFS
* FCP
* iSCSI
* NVMe

.Steps
. In the *Performance/SVM Explorer* page for your selected SVM, from the IOPS chart, select *Protocols* from the drop-down menu.
+
The IOPS - Protocols chart is displayed.

. To view a larger version of the chart, select *Zoom View*.
+
The IOPS advanced protocol comparative chart is displayed. You can restrict the comparison by deselecting or selecting the image:../media/eye_icon.gif[] that is associated with a protocol.

. To view the specific values, move your cursor into the chart area of either chart to see the popup window.
