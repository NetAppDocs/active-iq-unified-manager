Unified Manager uses the deviation in activity, utilization, write throughput, cluster component usage, or I/O latency (response time) for a workload to determine the level of impact to workload performance. This information determines the role of each workload in the event and how they are ranked on the Event details page.

Unified Manager compares the last analyzed values for a workload to the expected range (latency forecast) of values. The difference between the values last analyzed and the expected range of values identifies the workloads whose performance was most impacted by the event.

For example, suppose a cluster contains two workloads: Workload A and Workload B. The latency forecast for Workload A is 5-10 milliseconds per operation (ms/op) and its actual latency is usually around 7 ms/op. The latency forecast for Workload B is 10-20 ms/op and its actual latency is usually around 15 ms/op. Both workloads are well within their latency forecast. Due to contention on the cluster, the latency of both workloads increases to 40 ms/op, crossing the dynamic performance threshold, which is the upper bounds of the latency forecast, and triggering events. The deviation in latency, from the expected values to the values above the performance threshold, for Workload A is around 33 ms/op, and the deviation for Workload B is around 25 ms/op. The latency of both workloads spike to 40 ms/op, but Workload A had the bigger performance impact because it had the higher latency deviation at 33 ms/op.

On the Event details page, in the System Diagnosis section, you can sort workloads by their deviation in activity, utilization, or throughput for a cluster component. You can also sort workloads by latency. When you select a sort option, Unified Manager analyzes the deviation in activity, utilization, throughput, or latency since the event was detected from the expected values to determine the workload sort order. For the latency, the red dots (image:../media/opm_incident_icon_png.gif[Performance Manager warning icon]) indicate a performance threshold crossing by a victim workload, and the subsequent impact to the latency. Each red dot indicates a higher level of deviation in latency, which helps you identify the victim workloads whose latency was impacted the most by an event.
