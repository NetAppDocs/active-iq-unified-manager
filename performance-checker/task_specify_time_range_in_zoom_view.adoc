The *Time Range* control in the Counter Charts Zoom View window enables you to specify a date and time range for the selected chart. This enables you to quickly locate specific data based on either a preset time range or your own custom time range.

You can select a time range between one hour and 390 days. 13 months equals 390 days because each month is counted as 30 days. Specifying a date and time range provides more detail and enables you to zoom in on specific performance events or series of events. Specifying a time range also aids in troubleshooting potential performance issues, as specifying a date and time range displays data surrounding the performance event in finer detail. Use the *Time Range* control to select predefined date and time ranges, or specify your own custom date and time range of up to 390 days. Buttons for predefined time ranges vary from the *Last Hour* through the *Last 13 Months*.

Selecting the *Last 13 Months* option or specifying a custom date range greater than 30 days displays a dialog box alerting you that performance data displayed for a period greater than 30 days is charted using hourly averages and not 5-minute data polling. Therefore, a loss of timeline visual granularity might occur. If you click the *Do not show again* option in the dialog box, the message does not appear when you select the *Last 13 Months* option or specify a custom date range greater than 30 days. Summary data also applies on a smaller time range, if the time range includes a time/date that is more than 30 days from today.

When selecting a time range (either custom or predefined), time ranges of 30 days or fewer are based on 5-minute interval data samples. Time ranges greater than 30 days are based on one-hour interval data samples.
