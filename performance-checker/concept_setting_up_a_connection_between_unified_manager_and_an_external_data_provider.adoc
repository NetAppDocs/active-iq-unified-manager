A connection between a Unified Manager server and an external data provider enables you to send cluster performance data to an external server so that storage managers can chart the performance metrics using third-party software.

A connection between a Unified Manager server and an external data provider is established through the menu option labeled "`External Data Provider`" in the maintenance console.
