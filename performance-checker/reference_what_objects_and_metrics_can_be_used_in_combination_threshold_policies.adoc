Only some performance counters can be used together in combination policies. When primary and secondary performance counters are specified, both performance counters must exceed their maximum limits before an event is generated.

[NOTE]
====
When a volume combination policy is applied to a FlexGroup volume, instead of to a FlexVol volume, only the "`Volume IOPS`" and "`Volume MB/s`" attributes can be selected as the secondary counter. If the threshold policy contains one of the node or aggregate attributes, then the policy will not be applied to the FlexGroup volume, and you will receive an error message describing this case. This is because FlexGroup volumes can exist on more than one node or aggregate.
