Unified Manager collects and analyzes workload activity every 5 minutes to identify performance events, and it detects configuration changes every 15 minutes. It retains a maximum of 30 days of 5-minute historical performance and event data, and it uses this data to forecast the expected latency range for all monitored workloads.

Unified Manager must collect a minimum of 3 days of workload activity before it can begin its analysis and before the latency forecast for I/O response time can be displayed on the Workload Analysis page and in the Event details page. While this activity is being collected, the latency forecast does not display all changes occurring from workload activity. After collecting 3 days of activity, Unified Manager adjusts the latency forecast every 24 hours at 12:00 a.m., to reflect workload activity changes and establish a more accurate dynamic performance threshold.

During the first 4 days that Unified Manager is monitoring a workload, if more than 24 hours have passed since the last data collection, the latency charts will not display the latency forecast for that workload. Events detected prior to the last collection are still available.

[NOTE]
====
Daylight savings time (DST) changes the system time, which alters the latency forecast of performance statistics for monitored workloads. Unified Manager immediately begins to correct the latency forecast, which takes approximately 15 days to complete. During this time you can continue to use Unified Manager, but, since Unified Manager uses the latency forecast to detect dynamic events, some events might not be accurate. Events detected prior to the time change are not affected.
