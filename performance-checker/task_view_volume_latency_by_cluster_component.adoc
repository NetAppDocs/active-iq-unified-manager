You can view detailed latency information for a volume by using the Volume Performance Explorer page. The Latency - Total counter chart shows total latency on the volume, and the Latency - Breakdown counter chart is useful for determining the impact of read and write latency on the volume.

Additionally, the Latency - Cluster Components chart shows a detailed comparison of the latency of each cluster component to help determine how each component contributes to the total latency on the volume. The following cluster components are displayed:

* Network
* QoS Limit Max
* QoS Limit Min
* Network Processing
* Cluster Interconnect
* Data Processing
* Aggregate Operations
* Volume Activation
* MetroCluster Resources
* Cloud Latency
* Sync SnapMirror

.Steps
. In the *Volume Performance Explorer* page for your selected volume, from the Latency chart, select *Cluster Components* from the drop-down menu.
+
The Latency - Cluster Components chart is displayed.

. To view a larger version of the chart, select *Zoom View*.
+
The cluster component comparative chart is displayed. You can restrict the comparison by deselecting or selecting the image:../media/eye_icon.gif[] that is associated with each cluster component.

. To view the specific values, move your cursor into the chart area to see the popup window.
