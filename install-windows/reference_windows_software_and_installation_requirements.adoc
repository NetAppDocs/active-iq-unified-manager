The server should be dedicated to running Unified Manager. No other applications should be installed on the server. It is possible that an active anti-virus software is installed on your Windows system because of company regulations. You should disable the anti-virus software before installing Unified Manager to prevent the installation from failing. 

== Third-party software

The following third-party packages are bundled with Unified Manager. If these third-party packages are not installed on your system, Unified Manager installs them as a part of the installation.

* Microsoft Visual C{pp} 2015 Redistributable package version 14.26.28720.3
* Microsoft Visual C{pp} Redistributable Packages for Visual Studio 2013 version 12.0.40660.0
* MySQL Community Edition version 8.0.34
* Python 3.11.6
* OpenJDK version 11.0.20
* p7zip version 23.01 or later

[NOTE]
====
Starting with Unified Manager 9.5, OpenJDK is provided in the Unified Manager installation package and installed automatically. Oracle Java is not supported starting with Unified Manager 9.5.
====

If MySQL is pre-installed, you should ensure that:

* It is using the default port.
* The sample databases are not installed.
* The service name is "`MYSQL8`".

Unified Manager is deployed on a WildFly web server. WildFly 26.1.3 is bundled and configured with Unified Manager.

[NOTE]
====
You should shut down a running instance of Unified Manager before upgrading any third-party software. After the third-party software installation is complete, you can restart Unified Manager.
====

== Installation requirements

* Microsoft .NET 4.5.2, or greater, should be installed.
* The `temp` directory should be configured with 2 GB of disk space for extracting the installation files. To verify whether the directory is created, run the following command on the command-line interface: `echo %temp%`
* You should reserve 2 GB of disk space in the Windows drive for caching the Unified Manager MSI files.
* The Microsoft Windows Server on which you want to install Unified Manager should be configured with a fully qualified domain name (FQDN) such that `ping` responses to the host name and FQDN are successful.
* You should disable Microsoft IIS worldwide web publishing service and ensure that ports 80 and 443 are free.
* You should make sure that the Remote Desktop Session Host setting for "`Windows Installer RDS Compatibility`" is disabled during the installation.
* UDP port 514 should be free, and should not be used by any other service.
* You should disable all anti-virus software on your system before installing Unified Manager. After your installation is complete, make sure to manually exclude the following paths from anti-virus scan:

** Unified Manager data directory, for example, `C:\ProgramData\NetApp\OnCommandAppData\`
** Unified Manager installation directory, for example, `\C:\Program Files\NetApp\`
** MySQL data directory, for example, `C:\ProgramData\MySQL\MySQLServerData`
