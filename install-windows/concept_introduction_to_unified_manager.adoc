Active IQ Unified Manager (formerly OnCommand Unified Manager) enables you to monitor and manage the health and performance of your ONTAP storage systems from a single interface. You can deploy Unified Manager on a Linux server, on a Windows server, or as a virtual appliance on a VMware host.

After you have completed the installation and have added the clusters that you want to manage, Unified Manager provides a graphical interface that displays the capacity, availability, protection, and performance status of the monitored storage systems.
