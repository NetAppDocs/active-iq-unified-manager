If you created a custom home directory to define your own umadmin user and maintenance account prior to installing Unified Manager, you should remove these items after you have uninstalled Unified Manager.

The standard Unified Manager uninstallation does not remove a custom-defined umadmin user and maintenance account. You must delete these items manually.

.Steps

. Log in as the root user to the Red Hat Enterprise Linux server.
. Delete the umadmin user:
+
`userdel umadmin`
. Delete the maintenance group:
+
`groupdel maintenance`
