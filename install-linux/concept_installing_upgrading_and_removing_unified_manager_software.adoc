On Linux systems, you can install Unified Manager software, upgrade to a newer version of software, or remove Unified Manager.

Unified Manager can be installed on Red Hat Enterprise Linux or CentOS servers. The Linux server on which you install Unified Manager can be running either on a physical machine or on a virtual machine running on VMware ESXi, Microsoft Hyper-V, or Citrix XenServer.
