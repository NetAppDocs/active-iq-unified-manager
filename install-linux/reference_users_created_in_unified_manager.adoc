[.lead]
When you install Unified Manager on Red Hat Enterprise Linux or CentOS, the following users are created by Unified Manager and third-party utilities: umadmin, jboss, and mysql.

* *umadmin*
+
Used to log in to Unified Manager for the first time. This user is assigned an "`Application Administrator`" user role and is configured as the "`Maintenance User`" type. This user is created by Unified Manager.

* *jboss*
+
Used to run Unified Manager services related to the JBoss utility. This user is created by Unified Manager.

* *mysql*
+
Used to run MySQL database queries of Unified Manager. This user is created by the MySQL third-party utility.

In addition to these users, Unified Manager also creates corresponding groups: maintenance, jboss, and mysql. The maintenance and jboss groups are created by Unified Manager, while the mysql group is created by a third-party utility.

[NOTE]
====
If you created a custom home directory and defined your own umadmin user password prior to installing Unified Manager, the installation program does not recreate the maintenance group or the umadmin user.
