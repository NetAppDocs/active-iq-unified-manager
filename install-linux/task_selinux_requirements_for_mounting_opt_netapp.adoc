If you are planning to mount `/opt/netapp` or `/opt/netapp/data` on an NAS or SAN device, and you have SELinux enabled, you need to be aware of a few considerations.

If you are planning to mount `/opt/netapp` or `/opt/netapp/data` from anywhere other than the root file system, and you have SELinux enabled in your environment, you should set the correct context for the mounted directories.
For the applicable scenario in your environment, follow these steps for setting and confirming the correct SELinux context.

== Configuring the SELinux context when `/opt/netapp/data` is mounted

If you have mounted `/opt/netapp/data` in your system and SELinux is set to `Enforcing`, ensure that the SELinux context type for `/opt/netapp/data` is set to `mysqld_db_t`, which is the default context element for the location of the database files.

. Run this command to check the context:
+
`ls -dZ /opt/netapp/data`
+
A sample output:
+
----
drwxr-xr-x. mysql root unconfined_u:object_r:default_t:s0 /opt/netapp/data
----
+
[NOTE]
In this output, the context is `default_t`. You should change this context to `mysqld_db_t`.

. Perform these steps to set the context based on how you have mounted `/opt/netapp/data`.
 .. Run the following commands to set the context to `mysqld_db_t`:
----
semanage fcontext -a -t mysqld_db_t "/opt/netapp/data"
restorecon -R -v /opt/netapp/data
----
 .. If you have configured `/opt/netapp/data` in `/etc/fstab`, you should edit the `/etc/fstab` file. For the `/opt/netapp/data/` mount option, add the MySQL label as:
+
`context=system_u:object_r:mysqld_db_t:s0`
 .. Unmount and remount `/opt/netapp/data/` for enabling the context.
 .. If you have a direct NFS mount, run the following command to set the context to `mysqld_db_t`:
+
`mount <nfsshare>:/<mountpoint> /opt/netapp/data -o context=system_u:object_r:mysqld_db_t:s0`
. Verify whether the context is set correctly:

`ls -dZ /opt/netapp/data/`

A sample output:
----
drwxr-xr-x. mysql root unconfined_u:object_r:mysqld_db_t:s0 /opt/netapp/data/
----

== Configuring the SELinux context when `/opt/netapp` is mounted, and `/opt/netapp/data/` is also mounted separately

In this scenario, at first, you should set the context for `/opt/netapp/data/` as described in the previous section. After setting the correct context for `/opt/netapp/data/`, ensure that the parent directory `/opt/netapp` does not have the SELinux context set to `file_t`.

.Steps
. Run this command to check the context:
+
`ls -dZ /opt/netapp`
+
A sample output:
+
----
drwxr-xr-x. mysql root unconfined_u:object_r:file_t:s0 /opt/netapp
----
+
In this output, the context is `file_t` should be changed. The following commands set the context to `usr_t`. You can set the context to any value other than `file_t` based on your security requirements.

. Perform these steps to set the context, based on how you have mounted `/opt/netapp`.
 .. Run the following commands to set the context:
----
semanage fcontext -a -t usr_t "/opt/netapp"
restorecon -v /opt/netapp
----
 .. If you have configured `/opt/netapp` in `/etc/fstab`, you should edit the `/etc/fstab` file. For the `/opt/netapp` mount option, add the MySQL label as:
+
`context=system_u:object_r:usr_t:s0`
 .. Unmount, and then again mount `/opt/netapp` for enabling the context.
 .. If you have a direct NFS mount, run the following command to set the context:
+
`mount <nfsshare>:/<mountpoint> /opt/netapp -o context=system_u:object_r:usr_t:s0`
+
. Verify whether the context is set correctly:
+
`ls -dZ /opt/netapp`
+

If you have mounted  `/opt/netapp` in your system and SELinux is set to `Enforcing`, ensure that the SELinux context type for `/opt/netapp` is set to `mysqld_db_t`, which is the default context element for the location of the database files.
