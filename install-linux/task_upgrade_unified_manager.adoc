[.lead]
You can upgrade from Unified Manager 9.12 or 9.13 to 9.14 by downloading and running the installation file on the Linux platform.

*What you'll need*

* The system on which you are upgrading Unified Manager must meet the system and software requirements.
+
See link:concept_virtual_infrastructure_or_hardware_system_requirements.html[Hardware system requirements].
+
See link:reference_red_hat_and_centos_software_and_installation_requirements.html[Linux software and installation requirements].
* You must have a subscription to the Red Hat Enterprise Linux Subscription Manager.
* You must install, or upgrade to the correct version of OpenJDK prior to upgrading Unified Manager.
+
See link:task_upgrade_openjdk_on_linux_ocum.html[Upgrading JRE on Linux].
+
* To avoid data loss, you must have created a backup of the Unified Manager database in case there is an issue during the upgrade. NetApp recommends that you move the backup file from the `/opt/netapp/data` directory to an external location.
* During upgrade, you may be prompted to confirm whether you want to keep the previous, default settings for retaining performance data for 13 months or to change it to 6 months. On confirming, the historical performance data is purged after 6 months.
* You should have completed any running operations, because Unified Manager is unavailable during the upgrade process.
* MySQL Community Edition is automatically upgraded during Unified Manager upgrade. If the installed version of MySQL on your system is earlier than 8.0.34, the Unified Manager upgrade process automatically upgrades MySQL to 8.0.34.

.Steps

. Log in to the target Red Hat Enterprise Linux or CentOS server.
. Download the Unified Manager bundle to the server.
+
See link:task_download_unified_manager.html[Downloading Unified Manager for Linux].

. Navigate to the target directory and expand the Unified Manager bundle:
+
`unzip ActiveIQUnifiedManager-<version>.zip`
+
The required RPM modules for Unified Manager are unzipped to the target directory.

. Verify that the following module is available in the directory:
+
`ls *.rpm`
+
`netapp-um<version>.x86_64.rpm`
. Run the pre-installation script to ensure that there are no system configuration settings or any installed software that might conflict with the upgrade:
+
`sudo ./pre_install_check.sh`
+
The pre-installation script checks that the system has a valid Red Hat Enterprise Linux subscription, and that it has access to the required software repositories. If the script identifies any issues, you must fix the issues and continue with the upgrade. 
+
If there are any missing packages detected, perform the steps mentioned in link:../install-linux/task_upgrade_unified_manager.html#additional-steps-to-perform-for-missing-packages[Additional steps to perform for missing packages]. If there are no missing packages, continue with the next steps.

. Upgrade Unified Manager using the following script:
+
`upgrade.sh`
+
This script automatically executes the RPM modules, upgrading the necessary supporting software and the Unified Manager modules that run on them. Additionally, the upgrade script checks whether there are any system configuration settings or any installed software that might conflict with the upgrade. If the script identifies any issues, you must fix the issues before upgrading Unified Manager. If you have previously installed packages, such as _net-snmp_ before you upgraded Unified Manager, the MySQL dependency might uninstall the package during upgrade. You need to install the package manually again for continuing to use it.
+
. After the upgrade is complete, scroll back through the messages until you see the message displaying an IP address or URL for the Unified Manager web UI, the maintenance user name (umadmin), and the default password.
+
The message is similar to the following:
+
----
Active IQ Unified Manager upgraded successfully.
Use a web browser and one of the following URLs to access the Unified Manager GUI:

https://default_ip_address/    (if using IPv4)
https://[default_ip_address]/  (if using IPv6)
https://fully_qualified_domain_name/
----

Enter the specified IP address or URL in a new window of a supported web browser to start the Unified Manager web UI, and then log in by using the same maintenance user name (umadmin) and password that you set earlier. 

== Additional steps to perform for missing packages
If there are any missing packages detected at your site during upgrade, or if your system is not connected to the internet, or you are not using the Red Hat Enterprise Linux repositories, perform the following steps to determine whether you are missing any required packages and download those packages.

[NOTE]
These steps need to be performed after step _5_ of the main procedure. This procedure upgrades Unified Manager and you do not need to run any additional steps for upgrade.

. View the list of available and unavailable packages:
+
`yum install netapp-um<version>.x86_64.rpm --assumeno`
+
The items in the "`Installing:`" section are the packages that are available in the current directory, and the items in the "`Installing for dependencies:`" section are the packages that are missing on your system.

. On a different system that has the internet access, run the following command to download the missing packages.
+
`yum install package_name --downloadonly --downloaddir=.`
+
The packages are downloaded in the directory specified as `--downloaddir=`.
+
Because the plug-in "`yum-plugin-downloadonly`" is not always enabled on Red Hat Enterprise Linux systems, you might need to enable the functionality to download a package without installing it:
+
`yum install yum-plugin-downloadonly`

. Copy the downloaded packages to the directory where you unzipped the Unified Manager bundle on the installation system.
. Change directories to that directory and run the following command for installing the missing packages, along with their dependencies.
+
`yum install *.rpm`
. Start the Unified Manager server. Run these commands:
+
`systemctl start ocie`
+
`systemctl start ocieau`

This process completes the Unified Manager upgrade process. Enter the specified IP address or URL in a new window of a supported web browser to start the Unified Manager web UI, and then log in by using the same maintenance user name (umadmin) and password that you set earlier.
