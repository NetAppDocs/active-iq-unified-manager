You can upgrade to a newer version of OpenJDK on the Linux server on which Unified Manager is installed to obtain fixes for security vulnerabilities.

*What you'll need*

You must have root privileges for the Linux system on which Unified Manager is installed.

You can update OpenJDK releases within release families. For example, you can upgrade from OpenJDK 11.0.9 to OpenJDK 11.0.12, but you cannot update directly from OpenJDK 11 to OpenJDK 12.

.Steps

. Log in as a root user on the Unified Manager host machine.
. Download the appropriate version of OpenJDK (64-bit) to the target system.
. Stop the Unified Manager services:
+
`systemctl stop ocieau`
+
`systemctl stop ocie`
. Install the latest OpenJDK on the system.
. Start the Unified Manager services:
+
`systemctl start ocie`
+
`systemctl start ocieau`
