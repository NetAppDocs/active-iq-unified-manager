You can create a report that displays volume transfer trends at specific time intervals.

*What you'll need*

* You must have the Application Administrator or Storage Administrator role.

Use the following steps to create a custom view for volumes at specific time intervals, and then schedule a report to be generated for that view.

.Steps

. In the left navigation pane, click *Storage* > *Volumes*.
. In the View menu, select *Relationship* > *Last 1 month Transfer Status*.
. Select *Show/Hide* to remove any columns you do not want in the report.
. Drag the Transfer Duration column near the "`Operational Result`" column.
. Click the filter icon, add the following filter, and then click *Apply Filter*:
 ** Transfer End Time in the last 7 Days
. Click the top of the "`Transfer Duration`" column to sort the volumes by time interval.
. Save the view with a specific name that reflects what the view is showing, for example "`Volumes by duration`".
. Click the *Scheduled Reports* button on the inventory page.
. Enter a name for the report schedule, set the frequency as *Weekly*, and complete the other report fields, then click the check mark (image:../media/blue_check.gif[]) at the end of the row.

The report is sent immediately as a test. After that, the report generates and is sent by email to the recipients listed using the specified frequency.

Based on the results shown in the report, you can investigate the transfer time intervals.
