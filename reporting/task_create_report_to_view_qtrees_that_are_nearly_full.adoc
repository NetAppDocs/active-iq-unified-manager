You can create a report to analyze storage capacity and utilization of qtrees, and to view qtrees that are nearly full.

*What you'll need*

* You must have the Application Administrator or Storage Administrator role.

Use the following steps to create a custom view that displays qtrees that are nearly full, and then schedule a report to be generated for that view.

.Steps

. In the left navigation pane, click *Storage* > *Qtrees*.
. Select *Show/Hide* to remove any columns you do not want in the report.
. Drag the "`Disk Used %`" column near the "`Qtrees`" column.
. Click the filter icon, add the following filters, and then click *Apply Filter*:
 ** Disk Used % is greater than 75%
. Click the top of the "`Disk Used %`" column to sort the results by capacity percent.
. Save the view with a specific name that reflects what the view is showing, for example, "`Qtrees nearing full`", and click the check mark (image:../media/blue_check.gif[]).
. Click the *Scheduled Reports* button on the inventory page.
. Click *Add Schedule* to add a new row to the *Report Schedules* page so you can define the schedule characteristics for the new report.
. Enter a name for the report schedule and complete the other report fields, then click the check mark (image:../media/blue_check.gif[]) at the end of the row.

The report is sent immediately as a test. After that, the report generates and is sent by email to the recipients listed using the specified frequency.

Based on the results shown in the report, you might want to adjust the disk hard and soft limits (if set), or balance data across the qtrees.
