. Select *Show/Hide* to remove any columns that you do not want in the report.
. Click the filter icon, add the following filter, and then click *Apply Filter*:
 ** Mount Path Active is No
. Save the view with a specific name that reflects what the view is showing, for example "`Volumes with an inaccessible mount path`" and click the check mark (image:../media/blue_check.gif[]).
. Click the *Scheduled Reports* button on the inventory page.
. Click *Add Schedule* to add a new row to the Report Schedules page so you can define the schedule characteristics for the new report.
