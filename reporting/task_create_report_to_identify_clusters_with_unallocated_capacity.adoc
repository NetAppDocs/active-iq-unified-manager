You can create a report to find the clusters with the most unallocated LUN capacity, greater than .5 TB, to help identify where you can add additional workloads.

*What you'll need*
* You must have the Application Administrator or Storage Administrator role.

Use the following steps to create a custom view that displays clusters with the most unallocated LUN capacity, and then schedule a report to be generated for that view.

.Steps

. In the left navigation pane, click *Storage* > *Clusters*.
. In the View menu, select *Capacity* > *All Clusters*.
. Select *Show/Hide* to remove any columns you do not want in the report.
. Drag the "`Unallocated LUN Capacity`" column near the "`HA Pair`" column.
. Click the filter icon, add the following filter, and then click *Apply Filter*:
 ** Unallocated LUN capacity greater than 0.5 TB
. Click the top of the "`Unallocated LUN Capacity`" column to sort the results by the greatest amount of unallocated LUN capacity.
. Save the view with a specific name that reflects what the view is showing, for example "`Most unallocated LUN capacity`" and click the check mark (image:../media/blue_check.gif[]).
. Click the *Scheduled Reports* button on the inventory page.
. Click *Add Schedule* to add a new row to the Report Schedules page so that you can define the schedule characteristics for the new report.
. Enter a name for the report schedule and complete the other report fields, then click the check mark (image:../media/blue_check.gif[]) at the end of the row.

The report is sent immediately as a test. After that, the report generates and is sent by email to the recipients listed using the specified frequency.

Based on the results shown in the report, you might want to use the unallocated LUN capacity of the cluster.
