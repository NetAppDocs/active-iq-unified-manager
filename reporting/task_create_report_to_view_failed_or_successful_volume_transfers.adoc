You can create a report that displays the status of volume transfers. You can view both failed and successful volume transfers in this report.

*What you'll need*

* You must have the Application Administrator or Storage Administrator role.

Use the following steps to create a custom view to show which transfers failed and which were successful, and then schedule a report to be generated for that view.

.Steps

. In the left navigation pane, click *Storage* > *Volumes*.
. In the View menu, select *Relationship* > *Last 1 month Transfer Status*.
. Select *Show/Hide* to remove any columns that you do not want in the report.
. Drag the "`Operation Result`" column near the "`State`" column.
. Click the top of the "`Opeateration Result`" column to sort the volumes by the status.
. Save the view with a specific name that reflects what the view is showing, for example "`Volumes by transfer status`".
. Click the *Scheduled Reports* button on the inventory page.
. Enter a name for the report schedule and complete the other report fields, then click the check mark (image:../media/blue_check.gif[]) at the end of the row.

The report is sent immediately as a test. After that, the report generates and is sent by email to the recipients listed using the specified frequency.

Based on the results shown in the report, you can investigate the transfer status.
