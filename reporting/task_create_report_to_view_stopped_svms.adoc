You can create a report to display a list of all stopped SVMs.

*What you'll need*

* You must have the Application Administrator or Storage Administrator role.

Use the following the steps to create a custom view that displays stopped storage VMs, and then schedule a report to be generated for that view.

.Steps

. In the left navigation pane, click *Storage* > *Storage VMs*.
. In the View menu, select *Health* > *All Storage VMs*.
. Select *Show/Hide* to remove any columns that you do not want in the report.
. Drag the "`State`" column near the "`Storage VM`" column.
. Click the filter icon, add the following filter, and then click *Apply Filter*:
 ** State is Stopped
. Save the view with a specific name that reflects what the view is showing, for example "`Stopped SVMs`" and click the check mark (image:../media/blue_check.gif[]).
. Click the *Scheduled Reports* button on the inventory page.
. Click *Add Schedule* to add a new row to the *Report Schedules* page so that you can define the schedule characteristics for the new report.
. Enter a name for the report schedule and complete the other report fields, then click the check mark (image:../media/blue_check.gif[]) at the end of the row.

The report is sent immediately as a test. After that, the report generates and is sent by email to the recipients listed using the specified frequency.

Based on the results shown in the report, you might want to investigate why the SVM is stopped to see if you should restart the stopped SVMs.
