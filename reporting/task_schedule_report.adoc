After you have a view or Excel file that you want to schedule for regular generation and distribution, you can schedule the report.

*What you'll need*

* You must have the Application Administrator or Storage Administrator role.
* You must have configured the SMTP server settings in the *General* > *Notifications* page so that the reporting engine can send reports as email attachments to the list of recipients from the Unified Manager server.
* The email server must be configured to allow attachments to be sent with the generated emails.

Use the following steps to test and schedule a report to be generated for a view. Select or customize the view you want to use. The following procedure uses a network view that shows the performance of your network interfaces, but you can use any view you want.

.Steps

. Open your view. This example uses the default network view that shows LIF performance. In the left navigation pane, click *Network > Network Interfaces*.
. Customize the view as needed using the built-in Unified Manager features.
. After you customized the view, you can provide a unique name in the *View* field and click the check mark to save it.
