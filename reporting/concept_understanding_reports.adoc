Reports display detailed information about storage, network, quality of service, and protection relationships, helping you to identify and solve potential problems before they occur.

When you customize a view, you can save it with a unique name for future use. You can schedule a report based on that view to run on a regular basis and share it with others. You can also download the view in Excel to customize it using advanced Excel features, then upload that file back into Unified Manager . If you schedule a report using that view, it will use the Excel file you uploaded to create robust reports you can share.

You can manage all reports that have been scheduled from the Report Schedules page.

[NOTE]
====
You must have the Application Administrator or Storage Administrator role to manage reports.
====

You can download reports as comma-separated values (CSV), Excel, or PDF files.
