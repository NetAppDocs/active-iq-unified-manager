You can create a report to analyze storage capacity and use of aggregates, and to view aggregates that are overcommitted.

*What you'll need*

* You must have the Application Administrator or Storage Administrator role.

Use the following steps to create a custom view that displays aggregates that are exceeding the overcommitted threshold, then schedule a report to be generated for that view.

.Steps

. In the left navigation pane, click *Storage* > *Aggregates*.
. In the View menu, select *Capacity* > *All Aggregates*.
. Select *Show/Hide* to remove any columns that you do not want in the report.
. Drag the "`Overcommitted Capacity %`" column near the "`Aggregate`" column.
. Click the filter icon, add the following filters, and then click *Apply Filter*:
 ** Overcommitted Capacity % is greater than 100%
. Click the top of the "`Overcommitted Capacity %`" column to sort the results by capacity percent.
. Save the view with a specific name that reflects what the view is showing, for example, "`Aggregates overcommitted`", and click the check mark (image:../media/blue_check.gif[]).
. Click the *Scheduled Reports* button on the inventory page.
. Click *Add Schedule* to add a new row to the Report Schedules page so that you can define the schedule characteristics for the new report.
. Enter a name for the report schedule and complete the other report fields, then click the check mark (image:../media/blue_check.gif[]) at the end of the row.

The report is sent immediately as a test. After that, the report generates and is sent by email to the recipients listed using the specified frequency.

Based on the results shown in the report, you might want to add some more capacity to aggregates, or move some data from certain aggregates.
