You can create a report to analyze capacity in an Excel file by using summed totals and the clustered column chart format.

*What you'll need*

* You must have the Application Administrator or Storage Administrator role.

Use the following steps to open a Health: All Aggregates view, download the view in Excel, create an available capacity chart, upload the customized Excel file, and schedule the final report.

.Steps

. In the left navigation pane, click *Storage* > *Aggregates*.
. Select *Reports* > *Download Excel*.

Depending on your browser, you might need to click *OK* to save the file.

. If needed, click *Enable Editing*.
. In Excel, open the downloaded file.
. Create a new sheet (image:../media/excel_new_sheet_icon.png[]) after the `data` sheet and name it *Total Data Capacity*.
. Add the following columns on the new Total Data Capacity sheet:
 .. Total Data Capacity (GB)
 .. Committed Capacity (GB)
 .. Used Data Capacity (GB)
 .. Available Data Capacity (GB)
. In the first row of each column, enter the following formula, making sure that it references the data sheet (data!), and references the correct column and row specifiers for the data captured (Total Data Capacity pulls data from column E, rows 2 through 20).
 .. =SUM(data!E$2:data!E$20)
 .. =SUM(data!F$2:data!F$50)
 .. =SUM(data!G$2:data!G$50)
 .. =SUM(data!H$2:data!H$50)

+
The formula totals each column based on the current data.

. Using the *Design* and *Format* menus, which are available when the chart is selected, you can customize how the chart looks.
