You can create a report to analyze storage capacity and utilization of clusters based on storage system model.

*What you'll need*

* You must have the Application Administrator or Storage Administrator role.

Use the following steps to create a custom view that displays capacity by cluster model, and then schedule a report to be generated for that view.

.Steps

. In the left navigation pane, click *Storage* > *Clusters*.
. In the View menu, select *Capacity* > *All Clusters*.
. Select *Show/Hide* to remove any columns, such as "`Cluster FQDN`" and "`OS Version`", that you do not want in the report.
. Drag the "`Total Raw Capacity`", the "`Model/Family`", and the three aggregate columns near the "`Cluster`" column.
. Click the top of the "`Model/Family`" column to sort the results by cluster type.
. Save the view with a specific name that reflects what the view is showing, for example, "`Capacity by Cluster Model`".
. Click the *Scheduled Reports* button on the inventory page.
. Click *Add Schedule* to add a new row to the *Report Schedules* page so that you can define the schedule characteristics for the new report.
. Enter a name for the report schedule and complete the other report fields, then click the check mark (image:../media/blue_check.gif[]) at the end of the row.

The report is sent immediately as a test. After that, the report generates and is sent by email to the recipients listed using the specified frequency.

Based on the results shown in the report, you might want to add more capacity to certain clusters, or upgrade older cluster models.
