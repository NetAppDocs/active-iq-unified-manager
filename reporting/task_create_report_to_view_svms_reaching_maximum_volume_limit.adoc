You can create a report to find SVMs that are reaching the maximum volume limit.

*What you'll need*

* You must have the Application Administrator or Storage Administrator role.

Use the following steps to create a custom view that displays storage VMs that are reaching the maximum volume limit, and then schedule a report to be generated for that view.

.Steps

. In the left navigation pane, click *Storage* > *Storage VMs*.
. Select *Show/Hide* to remove any columns you do not want in the report.
. Drag the "`Volume Count`" and "`Maximum Allowed Volumes`" columns near the "`Storage VM`" column.
. Click the top of the "`Maximum Allowed Volumes`" column to sort the results by the highest number of volumes.
. Save the view with a specific name that reflects what the view is showing, for example "`SVMs reaching max volumes`" and click the check mark (image:../media/blue_check.gif[]).
. Click the *Scheduled Reports* button on the inventory page.
. Click *Add Schedule* to add a new row to the *Report Schedules* page so that you can define the schedule characteristics for the new report.
. Enter a name for the report schedule and complete the other report fields, then click the check mark (image:../media/blue_check.gif[]) at the end of the row.

The report is sent immediately as a test. After that, the report generates and is sent by email to the recipients listed using the specified frequency.

Based on the results shown in the report, you might want to balance the volumes assigned to storage VMs or, if possible, use ONTAP System Manager to change the maximum allowed volumes.
