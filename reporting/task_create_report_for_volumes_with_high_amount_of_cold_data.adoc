You can create a report to display volumes with a high amount of cold data on a non-FabricPool aggregate. This can help you identify volumes that should be moved to a FabricPool aggregate.

*What you'll need*

* You must have the Application Administrator or Storage Administrator role.

Use the following steps to create a custom view for volumes with a high amount of cold data on a non-FabricPool-enabled aggregate, and then schedule a report to be generated for that view.

.Steps

. In the left navigation pane, click *Storage* > *Volumes*.
. In the View menu, select *Performance* > *All Volumes*.
. Select *Show/Hide* to make sure the "`Disk Type`" column appears in the view.
+
Add or remove other columns to create a view that is important for your report.

. Drag the "`Disk Type`" column near the "`Cold Data`" column.
. Click the filter icon, add the following filter, and then click *Apply Filter*:
 ** Cold Data greater than 100 GB
 ** Disk Type contains SSD
. Click the top of the "`Disk Type`" column to sort the volumes by disk type so that the disk type SSD (FabricPool) is at the bottom.
. Save the view with a specific name that reflects what the view is showing, for example "`Cold data vols not FabricPool`".
. Click the *Scheduled Reports* button on the inventory page.
. Enter a name for the report schedule and complete the other report fields, then click the check mark (image:../media/blue_check.gif[]) at the end of the row.
+
The report is sent immediately as a test. After that, the report generates and is sent by email to the recipients listed using the specified frequency.

Based on the results shown in the report, you can find volumes that are good candidates to be moved to FabricPool aggregates.
