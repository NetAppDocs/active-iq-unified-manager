You can create a report that groups volumes by the reason the relationship is in an unhealthy state.

*What you'll need*

* You must have the Application Administrator or Storage Administrator role.

Use the following steps to create a custom view that groups volumes by source of failure, and then schedule a report to be generated for that view.

.Steps

. In the left navigation pane, click *Storage* > *Volumes*.
. In the View menu, select *Relationship* > *All Relationships*.
. Select *Show/Hide* to make sure the "`Relationship Health`" and "`Unhealthy Reason`" columns appear in the view.
+
Add or remove other columns to create a view that is important for your report.

. Drag the "`Relationship Health`" and "`Unhealthy Reason`" columns near the "`State`" column.
. Click the filter icon, add the following filter, and then click *Apply Filter*:
 ** Relationship health is bad
. Click the top of the "`Unhealthy Reason`" column to group the volume relationships by source of failure.
. Save the view with a specific name that reflects what the view is showing, for example, "`Vol relationships by failure`".
. Click the *Scheduled Reports* button on the inventory page.
. Enter a name for the report schedule and complete the other report fields, then click the check mark (image:../media/blue_check.gif[]) at the end of the row.
+
The report is sent immediately as a test. After that, the report generates and is sent by email to the recipients listed using the specified frequency.

Based on the results shown in the report, you can investigate the source and impact of each type of failure.
