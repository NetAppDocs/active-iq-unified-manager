You can create a report that groups volume relationships by issue.

*What you'll need*

* You must have the Application Administrator or Storage Administrator role.

Use the following steps to create a custom view that groups volume relationships by issue, and then schedule a report to be generated for that view.

.Steps

. In the left navigation pane, click *Storage* > *Volumes*.
. In the View menu, select *Relationship* > *All Relationships*.
. Select *Show/Hide* to remove any columns you do not want in the report.
. Drag the "`Unhealthy Reason`" column near the "`State`" column.
. Click the top of the "`Unhealthy Reason`" column to group the volumes by issue.
. Save the view with a specific name that reflects what the view is showing, for example, "`Vol relationships by issue`".
. Click the *Scheduled Reports* button on the inventory page.
. Enter a name for the report schedule and complete the other report fields, then click the check mark (image:../media/blue_check.gif[]) at the end of the row.

The report is sent immediately as a test. After that, the report generates and is sent by email to the recipients listed using the specified frequency.

Based on the results shown in the report, you can investigate the source and impact of each type of issue.
