Unified Manager can display events that have been discovered by the Active IQ platform. These events are created by running a set of rules against AutoSupport messages generated from all storage systems being monitored by Unified Manager.

For more information, see link:../events/concept_how_active_iq_platform_events_are_generated.html[How Active IQ platform events are generated]

Unified Manager checks for a new rules file automatically and only downloads a new file when there are newer rules. In sites with no external network access, you need to upload the rules manually from *Storage Management* > *Event Setup* > *Upload Rules*.

These Active IQ events do not overlap with existing Unified Manager events, and they identify incidents or risks concerning system configuration, cabling, best practice, and availability issues.

For more information about enabling platform events, see link:../config/concept_active_iq_platform_events.html[Enabling Active IQ portal events]
For more information about uploading rules file, see link:../events/task_upload_new_active_iq_rules_file.html[Uploading a new Active IQ rules file]
