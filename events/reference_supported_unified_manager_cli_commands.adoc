As a storage administrator you can use the CLI commands to perform queries on the storage objects; for example, on clusters, aggregates, volumes, qtrees, and LUNs. You can use the CLI commands to query the Unified Manager internal database and the ONTAP database. You can also use CLI commands in scripts that are executed at the beginning or end of an operation or are executed when an alert is triggered.

All commands must be preceded with the command `um cli login` and a valid user name and password for authentication.

a|
`um cli login -u <username> [-p <password>]`

a|
Displays all first level subcommands.
a|
`um run cmd [ -t <timeout> ] <cluster> <command>`
a|
The simplest way to run a command on one or more hosts. Mainly used for alert scripting to get or perform an operation on ONTAP. The optional timeout argument sets a maximum time limit (in seconds) for the command to complete on the client. The default is 0 (wait forever).
a|

a|
`um run query <sql command>`
a|

Adds a datasource to the list of managed storage systems. A datasource describes how connections to storage systems are made. The options -u (username) and -P (password) must be specified when adding a datasource. The option -t (protocol) specifies the protocol used to communicate with the cluster (http or https). If the protocol is not specified, then both protocols will be attempted The option -p (port) specifies the port used to communicate with the cluster. If the port is not specified, then the default value of the appropriate protocol will be attempted. This command can be executed only by the storage admin.
