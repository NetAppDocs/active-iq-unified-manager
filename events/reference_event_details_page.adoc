* *Event Name*

The name of the event and the time the event was last seen.

For non-performance events, while the event is in the New or Acknowledged state the last seen information is not known and is therefore hidden.

See _Cluster components and why they can be in contention_ for a description of the components that are displayed here.

The Event Information, System Diagnosis, and Suggested Actions sections are described in other topics.
