[.lead]
After you add an ONTAPI API based cluster to Unified Manager on a Windows operating system, the `nmsdk.log` file size increases and exceeds the 10 MB size limit.

*Cause*

This problem can happen if log rotation does not occur.

*Corrective action*

 .. Stop Unified Manager.
 .. When you are installing Unified Manager on Windows, install Logrotate version 0.0.0.18. For more information, see the link:https://www.netapp.com/pdf.html?item=/media/78941-tr-4945.pdf[Security hardening guide for NetApp Manageability SDK technical report^].
 .. Start Unified Manager.
