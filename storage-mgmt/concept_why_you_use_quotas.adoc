[.lead]
You can use quotas to limit resource usage in FlexVol volumes, to provide notification when resource usage reaches specific levels, or to track resource usage.

You specify a quota for the following reasons:

* To limit the amount of disk space or the number of files that can be used by a user or group, or that can be contained by a qtree
* To track the amount of disk space or the number of files used by a user, group, or qtree, without imposing a limit
* To warn users when their disk usage or file usage is high
