[.lead]
The dashboard provides cumulative at-a-glance information about the current health of your monitored ONTAP systems. The dashboard provides "`panels`" that enable you to assess the overall capacity, performance, and security health of the clusters you are monitoring.

Additionally, there are certain ONTAP issues that you can fix directly from the Unified Manager user interface instead of having to use ONTAP System Manager or the ONTAP CLI.

At the top of the dashboard you can select whether the panels show information for all monitored clusters or for an individual cluster. You can start by viewing the status of all clusters and then drill down to individual clusters when you want to view detailed information.
