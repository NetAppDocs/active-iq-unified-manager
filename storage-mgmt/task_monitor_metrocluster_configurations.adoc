You can monitor connectivity issues in your MetroCluster configuration. The details include the status of the components and connectivity within a cluster and the connectivity status between the clusters in the MetroCluster configuration.

*What you'll need*

* Both the local and remote clusters in the MetroCluster configuration must be added to Active IQ Unified Manager.
* You must have the Operator, Application Administrator, or Storage Administrator role.

You can use the information displayed in the Cluster / Health details page to rectify any connectivity issues. For example, if the connectivity between the node and the switch in a cluster is down, the following icon is displayed:

If you move the pointer over the icon, you can view detailed information about the generated event.

Unified Manager uses system health alerts to monitor the status of the components and connectivity in the MetroCluster configuration.

The MetroCluster Connectivity tab is displayed only for clusters in a MetroCluster configuration.

.Steps

. In the left navigation pane, click *Storage* > *Clusters*.
+
A list of all of the monitored clusters is displayed.

. From the *Health: All Clusters* view, click the name of the cluster for which you want to view MetroCluster configuration details.
. In the *Cluster / Health* details page, click the *MetroCluster Connectivity* tab.
+
The topology of the MetroCluster configuration is displayed in the corresponding cluster object area.

If you discover connectivity issues in your MetroCluster configuration, you must log in to System Manager or access the ONTAP CLI to resolve the issues.
