The notification bell (image:../media/notification_bell.png[]) in the menu bar provides a fast way to view the most important active events that Unified Manager is tracking.

The list of active events provides a way to see the total number of critical, error, warning, and upgrade events on all clusters. This list includes events from the previous 7 days, and it does not include Information events. You can click a link to display the list of events that you are most interested in.

Note that when a cluster is not reachable, Unified Manager displays this information in this page. You can view detailed information about a cluster that is unreachable by clicking the *Details* button. This action opens the Event details page. Scale monitoring issues, such as low space or RAM on the management station, are also displayed on this page.

.Steps

. From the menu bar, click image:../media/notification_bell.png[].
. To view details for any of the active events, click the event text link, such as "2 Capacity" or "4 Performance".
