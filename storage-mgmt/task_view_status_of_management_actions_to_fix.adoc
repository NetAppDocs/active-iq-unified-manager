You can view the status of all management actions that you have chosen to fix in the Management Actions page. Most actions are shown as *Completed* fairly quickly after Unified Manager sends the ONTAP command to the cluster. However, some actions, such as moving a volume, can take longer.

There are three filters available on the Management Actions page:

* *Completed* shows both management actions that completed successfully and those that have failed. *Failed* actions provide a reason for the failure so that you can address the issue manually.
* *In Progress* shows both those management actions that are being implemented, and those that are scheduled to be implemented.
* *Recommended* shows all the management actions that are currently active for all monitored clusters.

.Steps

. Click *Management Actions* on the left navigation pane. Alternately, click image:../media/more_icon.gif[] at the top of the *Management Actions* panel on the *Dashboard* and select the View you want to see.

The Management Actions page is displayed.

. You can click the caret icon next to the management action in the *Description* field to see details about the issue and the command that is being used to fix the issue.
. To view any actions that *failed*, sort on the *Status* column in the *Completed* View. You can use the *Filter* tool for this same purpose.
. If you want to view more information about a Failed management action, or if you decide that you want to fix a Recommended management action, you can click *View Event Detail* from the expanded area after you click the caret icon next to the management action. A *Fix It* button is available from that page.
